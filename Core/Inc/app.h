     pvPortMalloc() is called internally by the kernel whenever a task, queue,
     timer or semaphore is created.  It is also called by various parts of the
     demo application.  If heap_1.c or heap_2.c are used, then the size of the
     heap available to pvPortMalloc() is defined by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in
     FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used
     to query the size of free heap space that remains (although it does not
     provide information on how the remaining heap might be fragmented). */

     task.  It is essential that code added to this hook function never attempts
     to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
     specified, or call vTaskDelay()).  If the application makes use of the
     vTaskDelete() API function (as this demo application does) then it is also
     important that vApplicationIdleHook() is permitted to return to its calling
     function, because it is the responsibility of the idle task to clean up
     memory allocated by the kernel to any task that has since been deleted. */
